          </a>
        </p>
        <p class="indent_p">
          Implemented a Connect Four game in Python with AI opponent using the
          minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for decision-making.
          Gradually adjusted AI's exploration depth based on game progress to
          dynamically increase difficulty and reduce computation time.
          Incorporated CLI interface, board visualization, and winner
          determination.

        <p class="indent_p">
          Individually developed a GPS data analysis tool, enabling GPX file
          conversion to GeoDataFrame and timestamp localization. Executed pace
          calculations with smoothing and devised an independent classification
          system for activities. Identified optimal pace intervals. Introduced
          an efficiency score considering heart rate, elevation change, and
          pace. Utilized Python libraries like pandas, geopandas, and matplotlib
          for data manipulation and modeling.
